# Easy Generators Task Guide

This provides a guide line on how to start the project, note that all .env are not ignored for easiness of testing

Currently, two official methods are available:

## Running the app using Docker compose:
```bash
    # in the root directory
    $ docker compose up
```

## Running the app through dev setup:
```bash
    # from the root directory
    $ cd ./backend && yarn && yarn start:dev
    # from the root directory
    $ cd ./frontend && yarn && yarn dev
```
